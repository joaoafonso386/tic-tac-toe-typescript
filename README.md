# Tic Tac Toe Game - Written in vanilla typescript
### GOALS
- Practice programming logic by creating my own custom tic tac toe solution  
- Work with types as much as possible
- Abstract the code as much as possible to create a clean solution

### RULES

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You can be X, your friend can be O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. If all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
